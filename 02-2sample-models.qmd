<!-- # Overview of R Markdown files -->

In this class, you will work with your group to explore how to fit and interpret models to compare two population means. 

## Part 1: Understanding the study design

Before you begin analyzing the  games data discussed in Chapter 2, you need to review the study design and consider how the design impacts the conclusions that you can draw.

**Task 1:** Review the study design on page 31 and complete activities 1-4.

To complete the "individual values plot" for activity 4, check out the R Manual.


## Part 2: Statistical models for the two-sample t-test

As you saw before class, the underlying model for a two-sample t-test is given by

$$y_{ij} = \mu_i + \varepsilon_{ij}, \quad \text{ for } i=1,2, \quad j = 1,\ldots,n_i, \quad \text{where } \varepsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$

Let group 1 be the color distractor group and group 2 be the standard game group.

**Task 2.** Calculate estimates for the two population means.


## Part 3: Checking assumptions

The necessary assumptions/conditions for the two-sample t-test are:

1. the error terms are i.i.d.
1. the error terms follow a normal distribution
1. the error terms have mean 0
1. the population variance is the same for each group

Before conducting inference, we should check these assumptions/conditions. If they are violated, then our conclusions could be suspect.

### Data plot

As you saw earlier, you can assess some aspects of the error term distribution using a plot of the data (i.e., an individual value plot). 

- Is the spread the same between groups? Is it drastically different?
- Are there extreme outliers (unusual observations)?

### Residual plots

Most of the assumptions can be checked by estimating the error terms (i.e., calculating the residuals) and creating sensible plots.

- Histogram: could the residuals follow a normal distribution?
- Histogram by group: how does the spread compare between groups? Are both groups centered around 0?
- Boxplots by group: is the spread (IQR) about the same between groups?
- Residuals vs. time: is there 


### Comparing sample variances

In addition to graphically checking whether the spread of the residuals is similar between the groups, you can also conduct an informal comparison of the sample variances.

You book recommends that $\max(s_1^2, s_2^2)/\min(s_1^2, s_2^2) < 2$, but this is not a strict rule.


**Task 3:** Complete activities 7-10.
